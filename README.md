# Blockade

Blockade is an interactive website with a collection of classic arcade games that allows 
users to play the games and view a tutorial on how the game is made. 
This website features: 
<br>- Flappy Bird - inspited by http://www.lessmilk.com/tutorial/flappy-bird-phaser-1
<br>- Don't Touch the Spikes
<br>- Breakout

<h2> How it is built </h2>
This website was created from scratch using HTML and CSS. Additionally, the games were 
created using JavaScript and the Phaser 3, an HTML5 game development framework, to 
incorporate physics into the games.

<h2> Challenges </h2>
This website had a rough start because some time had passed since the last time I coded 
with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hence, the first game I created, Flappy, was based off 
a tutorial. This served as an excellent refresher for these languages as once I got 
the hang of it, I then went on to do my own take on Don't Touch the Spikes and Breakout. 
This was also my first time using Phaser 3, so I had to research and look into how it 
worked.
